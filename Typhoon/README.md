# Ricardo Board Template
This is a KiCad template including the required components for an ESP32S3 with a USB-C port, a CAN transceiver, as well as logic power input regulation. This is the bare minimum needed for boards in the ricardo ecosystem. If you have followed the [hardware library usage instructions](https://github.com/icl-rocketry/iclr-hw), the hardware libraries will automatically be added to every project started from this template.

## Usage
To use this, clone this repository in your KiCad user templates folder.

By default, this folder is:

MacOS - ```/Users/{USERNAME}/Documents/KiCad/8.0/template/```

Windows -  ```%USERPROFILE%/Documents/KiCad/8.0/template```

Linux - ```/home/{USERNAME}/.local/share/kicad/8.0/template```

Then, you will be able to access the template when making a new project in ```KiCad -> File -> New Project from Template... -> User Templates```
